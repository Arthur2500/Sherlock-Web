        <p>Your privacy is important to us. We only collect information necessary to provide the service, such as your IP address and how you use the app. This data helps us ensure the service runs smoothly and securely. We do not share your data with third parties.</p>

        <p>All data is deleted after processing is complete. If you request a CSV download, the file is stored temporarily and removed shortly after the download. We take reasonable steps to secure your data, but we can't guarantee absolute protection due to the nature of the internet.</p>

        <p>Our service is not intended for users under 18. By using Sherlock Web, you confirm that you meet this requirement.</p>

        <p>We may update this policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted here, so please check back occasionally.</p>
